# Bad Render Engine
I just made this because I was bored, and I made it in **Java Script** because I dislike **C++**.
I think most of the code works in a very awkward way.
The mesh rotation is a nightmare, works in a very weird way, and is a complete mess. I tried to improve it, but the only way to do that is redoing it from 0.

The engine features some render modes, base color render mode, wireframe render mode, solid color render mode, light preview render mode, depth preview render mode, and a complete render mode wich combines the base color and the light.

If you want to modify the background just replace the image called "Background.jpg", and the same goes for the light icon.
