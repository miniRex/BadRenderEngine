# Bad Render Engine
I just made this because I was bored, and I made it in **Java Script** because I dislike **C++**
I think most of the code works in a very awkward way
The mesh rotation is a nightmare, works in a very weird way, and is a complete mess. I tried to improve it, but the only way to do that is redoing it from 0
